# Sentiment-Analyzer-Cryptocurrencies-Experiment

There are lots of pre-trained NLP libraries for sentiment analysis and this project aims to see if there is a strong correlation between the price and the score given by these libraries (e.g. Vader, Flair, TextBlob). The project also attempted to train a sentiment classifier for crypto tweets. The interested crypto is this project is Binance Coin and Solana due to the available data at OpenBlender.io.
